To use the program, modify the variables NUM_ITERATIONS and RADIUS.

NUM_ITERATIONS = 2
RADIUS = 1.5

-= or =-

NUM_ITERATIONS = 3
RADIUS = 1.0

Then run the program using python v3 (any 3.x.y).

Go to /front/models. Add a new js file (or open an existing one).
Copy the first array into a model file, under the variable name vertices_something.
Copy the second array into a model file, under the variable name triangles_something.
Add, at the end of the file:
export Model_planet  = { vertices: vertices_something, trianglesIndexed: triangles_something };
